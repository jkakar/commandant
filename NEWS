## 0.5.0 (2013-05-09)

### Improvements

- Commandant has a new home at: https://github.com/jkakar/commandant
- The README has been updated and includes instructions on setting up
  a Virtualenv-based environment.


## 0.4.0 (2010-11-21)

### Improvements

- A new `commandant.testing` package has been added and the `mocker`
  and resources `modules` have been moved to it.  Also, a new
  `StdoutResource` has been to the resources module to handle mocking
  `sys.stdout`.
- A new `TwistedCommand` base class can be used to write command that
  need to run in a Twisted reactor.  If they return a `Deferred` the
  reactor will run until it fires and callbacks have been invoked.


## 0.3.0 (2009-12-27)

### Improvements

- The `CommandController` is now composed of four mixin classes that
  can be combined and tweaked to create custom controllers.
- `CommandController` takes optional parameters: program name, program
  version, program summary and program URL.  When provided, they are
  used in output generated by the `version` and `help` commands.
- The `version` command takes an optional `--short` command-line
  option that, when provided, causes it to output just the version
  number.
- The `version` command includes information about Python, `bzrlib`
  and `commandant` modules in its output, in addition to information
  about the program being run.
- A new `DocstringHelpTopic` can be subclassed to create topics that
  load summary and help content from the subclass's docstring.
- New `BzrlibHooksResource` test resource resets internal data
  structures in `bzrlib` that may have been modified by tests.
- `bzrlib`'s internal UI machinery is initialized before `bzrlib`
  hooks are installed.

### Bug fixes

- If the first option, expected to be the command path, starts with a
  `-` a usage message is shown, instead of an error about a missing
  path.
