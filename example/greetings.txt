Greetings are a way to initiate communication.

Greeting (also called accosting) is a way for human beings (as well
as other members of the animal kingdom) to intentionally communicate
awareness of each other's presence, to show attention to, and to
suggest a type of relationship or social status between individuals
or groups of people coming in contact with each other.
